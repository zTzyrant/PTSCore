# PTSCore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run dev` for a dev server, but I recommend running `npm run dev` because some configuration is running or configured under package.json. Then you can navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files in the PTSCore Project.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
